title: Using Flutter with Wails
---

Wails can host Flutter in three ways:

- Flutter Web in Wails WebView (100% reuse of existing stack)
- Flutter Desktop with gRPC IPC
- Flutter via FFI (Go as c-shared library loaded in Flutter)

Initialize:

```bash
wails init -t flutter-web -n myapp
wails init -t flutter-grpc -n myapp
wails init -t flutter-ffi -n myapp
```

Dev:
- `wails dev` launches the appropriate Flutter watcher and rebuilds Go on change.
- For `flutter-web`, Wails proxies the detected web server into the window.
- For `flutter-grpc`, Flutter connects to `grpc://127.0.0.1:50051`.
- For `flutter-ffi`, Wails rebuilds a c-shared library and touches `lib/reload.trigger` so Flutter can reload.

Build:
- `wails build` runs the configured Flutter build and embeds/bundles artifacts where applicable.
- For `flutter-ffi`, the shared library is written to `build/bin/` and should be bundled per-platform into your Flutter app.
